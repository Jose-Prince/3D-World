# No UVG's Sky

**No UVG's Sky** is a Rust-based 3D space exploration project where players can navigate a procedurally rendered solar system. The system includes a spaceship, one star, and five planets, all rendered with unique visual effects. Players can explore the system using various gameplay features such as collision avoidance, autopilot, and dynamic camera perspectives like a bird's-eye view.

## Features

- **Real-time Rendering**: Renders a spaceship, celestial bodies (star and planets), and a dynamic skybox.
- **Bird's-eye View**: Allows players to visualize the entire system from above.
- **Collision Avoidance**: Warns players of imminent collisions and automatically evades when necessary.
- **Barrel Roll Maneuver**: Perform barrel rolls to navigate or evade obstacles.
- **Minimap Integration**: Displays nearby celestial bodies relative to the ship.
- **Procedural Noise Generation**: Different noise algorithms for unique planet surfaces and star visuals.
- **Soundtrack**: Dynamic background music changes between menu and gameplay.

## Controls

| Key             | Action                              |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `W` / `A` / `S` / `D` | Move the spaceship in respective directions. |
| `Enter`         | Start the game.                     |
| `Escape`        | Exit the game.                      |
| `M`             | Toggle alternate rendering mode.    |

## Technologies Used

- **Rust**: Core programming language.
- **`minifb`**: Window management and input handling.
- **`nalgebra_glm`**: Linear algebra and 3D transformations.
- **`FastNoiseLite`**: Procedural noise generation for realistic planet textures.
- **Custom Graphics Pipeline**: Built from scratch for rendering, collision detection, and shading.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple modules for clarity and reusability:

- **`main.rs`**: Entry point and game loop.
- **`framebuffer`**: Handles pixel-level rendering.
- **`shader`**: Contains custom shaders for lighting and effects.
- **`camera`**: Manages camera transformations and perspective.
- **`skybox`**: Renders the background sky.
- **`minimap`**: Displays a bird's-eye view of the system.
- **`autopilot`**: Implements automatic collision evasion.
- **`audioPlayer`**: Handles background music playback.
- **`collisionWarning`**: Alerts for imminent collisions.
